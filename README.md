# SteganographyProject
SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY
Ensuring safe communication and data protection is essential in today's digital world. Conventional encryption techniques could draw notice and cause suspicion. The goal of this project is to create a steganography-based system that safely conceals messages inside pictures, guaranteeing secrecy and integrity while rendering them invisible to unauthorised users. Furthermore, conventional data security approaches are frequently subject to intrusions, therefore investigating alternate strategies for secure communication is essential. This project adds an additional degree of security by enclosing communications in graphics, guaranteeing that private data is shielded from possible dangers.
